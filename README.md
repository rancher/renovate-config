# renovate-config

This repository contains the centralized Renovate preset (`default.json`) and the reusable workflow used to run Renovate (`.github/workflows/renovate.yml`)

## Used branches

- `main` (aka develop), this is where the development happens and changes are introduced. This branch is kept up-to-date with Renovate pointing to its own preset.
- `release`, this is the branch where all the repositories point to. After testing our changes in `main`, we promote `main` to `release`.

## Dependency bump alignment across Rancher Manager

For easier alignment of versions across projects around the Rancher Manager
ecosystem, a few presets were created that enforce version constraints for each
Rancher minor version.

The presets are available at the root of this repository and follow the naming
convention: `rancher-<version>.json`. To use these presets, a project can configure
their `renovate.json` as per below:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "github>rancher/renovate-config//rancher-main#release"
  ],
  "baseBranches": [
    "main"
  ],
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchBaseBranches": ["releases/v0.7.x"],
      "extends": ["github>rancher/renovate-config//rancher-2.11#release"]
    },
    {
      "matchBaseBranches": ["releases/v0.6.x"],
      "extends": ["github>rancher/renovate-config//rancher-2.10#release"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing new changes

### Matching patterns / versions found

Renovate configuration is not very unit testing friendly. Therefore, this project aims to validate all renovate files for syntax issues via `make validate` at its PR checks.
This runs a strict check, so new formats which require migration will break.

When introducing new configuration, changes can be tested manually by adding a sample target file in `/tests` and running `make test` locally. To test the impact on a `Dockerfile` for example, create a `test/Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
ENV KUBECTL_VERSION v1.25.12
```

Results in:

```
DEBUG: packageFiles with updates (repository=local)
       "config": {
         "regex": [
           {
             "deps": [
               {
                 "depName": "kubernetes/kubernetes",
                 "currentValue": "v1.25.12",
                 "datasource": "github-releases",
                 "replaceString": "ENV KUBECTL_VERSION v1.25.12\n",
                 "skipReason": "github-token-required",
                 "updates": [],
                 "packageName": "kubernetes/kubernetes"
               },
               {
                 "depName": "kubernetes/kubernetes",
                 "currentValue": "v1.25.12",
                 "datasource": "github-releases",
                 "replaceString": "ARG KUBECTL_VERSION=v1.25.12\n",
                 "skipReason": "github-token-required",
                 "updates": [],
                 "packageName": "kubernetes/kubernetes"
               }
             ],
             "matchStrings": [
               "ENV KUBECTL_VERSION(\\=|\\s)(?<currentValue>.*?)\\n",
               "ARG KUBECTL_VERSION(\\=|\\s)(?<currentValue>.*?)\\n"
             ],
             "depNameTemplate": "kubernetes/kubernetes",
             "datasourceTemplate": "github-releases",
             "packageFile": "Dockerfile"
           }
         ]
       }
```

Some specific data sources will require a token (as per example above) which can be provided via the `GITHUB_COM_TOKEN` environment variable. This token requires read-only access to public repositories and it is used to fetch [changelogs] without being constraint by GH's API rate-limits.

### E2E testing
For non straight-forward changes, an effective way to confirm the
configuration is working as expected is to do a full renovate run.

#### Manually triggering the Renovate workflow
Push changes to a branch on the target repository (not your fork). On
the GitHub Actions tab, manually trigger renovate via the `run workflow`
button. Ensure that you pick the new branch and that "Override default log
level" is set to `debug` and "Override all schedules" is set to `true`.

Note that Renovate may at times merge your branch configuration
with the configuration from the `default` branch of that repository, which
may result in your settings not working as expected.
To understand the final config, check the section `DEBUG: Post-massage config`
of the logs - this is only visible when renovate is executed in
debug mode as per above.

#### Running on Forks
The execution in forks is possible by creating the secret `RENOVATE_FORK_GH_TOKEN`
in the fork repository, then triggering the Renovate workflow.
This provides the best way to test E2E scenarios, so that you can
manipulate dependency versions across the different branches in
the fork.
